                Suzi was born and raised in Brazil and moved to the US when she was 12, while John was born and raised in New York. It was definitely not love at first sight when they first met at UVA. Though they were friends, they were the meanest of friends. Playful or not, their interactions were nothing but hateful comments and death glares to each other that entire first year of school. Second year came around and through a series of group hangouts and unexpected events, such as John selflessly,generously, kind-heartedly helping Suzi move her couch into her apartment, they started to see the positives in one another. They were “not bad” and “alright” as they would describe one another. Through God’s grace, Suzi and John dated all throughout college and even after graduation where they both reside in Mclean, Virginia.  Currently, John is a consultant at Deloitte while Suzi is a medical student at Georgetown University. Though John is busy with his job, he still makes time to support Suzi in her studies by cooking for her and by listening to her complain about the million exams she has to take.

                    Loud, obnoxious, arrogant, and annoying were my first impressions of Nissi. I ended up becoming apartment mates with Nissi for two years and through God’s grace, I realized how rash my judgement was. I learned how passionate this guy is about his many hobbies and interests. I learned how he isn’t afraid to voice his opinions and point out your faults without being single-minded. Most importantly, I learned how good of a friend he is. Even after graduation, he goes out of his way to keep touch and takes time out his schedule to hang out. No matter what part of the world he is in, we have always managed to keep in touch and I’m truly grateful for that. He’s still loud though. But I don’t mind as much.

                    I don’t have many NY friends anymore even though I was born and raised there. Thankfully, Aaron is one of the few that kept me as a close friend. We don’t meet up often, but whenever we do, we are able to pick it back up from where we left off. I like to think our countless rounds of playing pool had something to do with that. Aaron is one of the smartest and the most trustworthy guys that I know. Adversity doesn’t stop this guy from getting the job done and doing what is right. That is the trait that I admire most about him. It saddens me to think that our limited number of hangouts will probably wither away to none. But I know for sure that he will do big things in Cali and I can’t wait for what God has in store for him.

                    James is one of the funniest guys that I know. He never fails to make me laugh with his lack of athleticism and his hideousness. But jokes aside, James has been someone that  I truly look up to and someone I learn a lot from. I like how our conversations are laden with quotes and references from our favorite TV shows, Simpsons & ParksandRec. It’s unnatural how much this guy remembers these shows by heart. James is energetic, hard-working, and very genuine. His goal of becoming a missionary might take him overseas, but I hope we can always keep in touch. Also, I will deny all of this in front of James so he doesn’t get the satisfaction. I will say instead he’s still unathletic and hideous.

Minsu is a lover of futbol, cars, and haemuljjim and is terrible at dancing, rapping and playing FIFA. Our favorite thing to do in the  apartment is sharing how our days went and complaining about work. Minsu is one of the most loyal, down-to-earth, chill guys that I know. My wish is that one day, Minsu and I will go watch a live soccer match between Manchester United and Barcelona. I want Minsu to watch Messi crush ManU.

Sara is one of the few who can third wheel with John and I and not feel awkward. Sara never fails to make me laugh, especially with her amazing dance skills. As we both go into the healthcare field, I hope that we can always support one another.

Jinmin is a huge encouragement to me and is one of the most hardworking and  reliable person I know. Whenever I have a tough time, I can always rely on Jinmin to pray for me. Even though I get really stressed when studying for exams, Jinmin always cheers me on by bringing me snacks and always checking up on me.

Whenever I share my struggles with her especially when John does something wrong, she is always willing to listen and gives great advice. When I’m MIA and busy with medical school, she always makes sure to check up on me and makes sure I’m doing well.

                    Rebeca is my little sister. When we were little, I would take full advantage of how Rebeca always wanted to play with me by ordering her around.  But now, I am the one always asking Rebeca for help when it comes to picking out outfits or asking her to do my makeup. Although I am not very good at expressing my love for my sister, I really appreciate and admire her. I know that I can always count on her.
